# Oscillatory behaviour modelling

This project explores the behaviour of different oscillatory probems in physics. Two variations of the Runge-kutta and the Adam-Moulton numerical solutions are used in the three different cases.

## earth.py
This script the orbit of planet earth is modelled by solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the 4th order runge-kutta method and visualized.

## 3star.py
This script explores the 3-body problem by modelling the orbit of 3 stars and their interactions with one another due to their gravitational field.

## pendulum.py
This script explores the motion of a double pendulum and a numerical solution to the differential equations are solved using the Adam-Moulton method.
